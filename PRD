# PRD — Drag-and-drop Multi-agent Orchestration (MCP + RAG)

## Overview

A platform to design, simulate, and execute multi-agent workflows with drag-and-drop tooling, MCP integration, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines. The system enables visual workflow authoring, AI-driven orchestration, and real-time monitoring.

## Goals

* Enable non-technical and technical users to design agent workflows visually.
* Support multi-tier orchestration with intelligent task routing.
* Integrate MCP capabilities and RAG for enriched context.
* Provide simulation mode for safe testing before live execution.

## Core Features

1. **Workflow Canvas** — drag-and-drop graph-based interface for building workflows.
2. **Run Viewer** — detailed, real-time view of workflow execution.
3. **Agent Library** — reusable agent templates with configurable parameters.
4. **MCP Integration** — standardized agent capabilities with tool registry.
5. **RAG Support** — contextual data retrieval for richer prompts.
6. **Collaboration** — multi-user editing and review.
7. **Approvals** — step-level human intervention workflows.

## User Roles

* **Builder:** Creates and edits workflows.
* **Reviewer:** Approves and comments on workflow steps.
* **Executor:** Launches workflows and monitors runs.
* **Admin:** Manages permissions and integrations.

## Success Metrics

* Time to build workflows reduced by 50%.
* 90%+ of workflows pass simulation without changes.
* Support at least 50 concurrent agents without degradation.
* <200ms API latency at 95th percentile.

## Tech Stack Summary
